## 🚀Features 
- **Easy input**: The program will let researchers easily input their details such as name, google scholar link, websites, funding opportunity etc and will 
                   help create a fantastic research proposal based on the rules specified at the funding website.
- **Agents**: All the heavy research tasks are done by multiple well crafted agents which work synchronously to write a fantastic research proposal. 

## 🚀Technologies Used 
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for developing the assistant.
- **Crew.ai**: Using crew.ai to build carefully crafted agents to do various taks synchronously to accomplish the goal of writing a research proposal.
